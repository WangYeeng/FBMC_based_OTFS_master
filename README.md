This code provides the numerical result of "FBMC-based Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation: A Pruned FFT-based Design Approach". The usage is summarized as follows.
（1）Fig. 4 is supported by "PowerSpectralDensity.m".
（2）Fig. 5 is supported by "PAPR.m".
（4）Fig. 6 - Fig. 10 are supported by "BERoverSNR.m", as well as Fig. 12. Note that they require a corresponding change in the channel parameters.
（5）Fig. 11 is supported by "SignalConstell.m".
Some other important conclusions (mentioned in the paper) can be found and reproduced in the provided code.
